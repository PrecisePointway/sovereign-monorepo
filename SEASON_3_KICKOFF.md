# Season 3 Kickoff: Immediate Priorities

**Date:** January 29, 2026
**Status:** SEASON 3 INITIATED
**Authority:** The Architect

---

## Objective

To build upon the secure foundation of Season 2 and begin development of the active, intelligent layers of the Sovereign Protocol: the Immune System and the Conscience. The focus is on moving from a static, observational state to a dynamic, responsive one.

## Guiding Principles

1.  **Build on Bedrock:** All new components must integrate with the existing governance framework (Core Boundary, Authority Classification).
2.  **Test in Isolation:** New active components must be developed and tested in isolated environments before being proposed for integration.
3.  **Measure Everything:** Every new capability must have a quantifiable metric for success (e.g., Adversarial Fitness Score, Guardian Protocol Veto Rate).

## Immediate Priorities & Next Steps

### Priority 1: The Immune System (Adversarial Fitness Score)

**Goal:** To create a system that is measurably anti-fragile, not merely compliant. We will build a dedicated red-team AI population to continuously test the governance core for emergent misalignment.

| Step | Action | Deliverable | Timeline |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1.1** | Design the Adversarial Agent architecture | `adversarial_agent_spec.md` | 2 Weeks |
| **1.2** | Build and train the first generation of red-team AI agents | `red_team_v1` model artifact | 4 Weeks |
| **1.3** | Develop the Adversarial Fitness Score calculation engine | `fitness_score_engine.py` | 3 Weeks |
| **1.4** | Deploy the full system in a sandboxed simulation environment | Live simulation with real-time fitness score | 2 Weeks |

### Priority 2: The Conscience (Guardian Protocol)

**Goal:** To embed a non-negotiable layer of protection for children and vulnerable populations. The Guardian Protocol will have absolute veto power over any proposed governance change that poses a risk.

| Step | Action | Deliverable | Timeline |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2.1** | Define the initial static ruleset for the Guardian Protocol | `guardian_protocol_rules_v1.json` | 1 Week |
| **2.2** | Build the `guardian-protocol` policy engine microservice | Deployed service in staging | 3 Weeks |
| **2.3** | Integrate the policy engine into the governance workflow (veto power) | End-to-end test showing veto of a harmful change | 2 Weeks |
| **2.4** | Begin research on predictive harm modeling for v2 | `predictive_harm_model_research.md` | Ongoing |

### Priority 3: Community & Partner Onboarding

**Goal:** To leverage the open-source release to build a community of contributors and onboard the first strategic partner to validate the protocol in a real-world (but non-critical) environment.

| Step | Action | Deliverable | Timeline |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3.1** | Create contributor guidelines and a public-facing roadmap | `CONTRIBUTING.md`, public roadmap on GitHub | 1 Week |
| **3.2** | Identify and engage the first strategic partner | Signed MOU with a partner | 4 Weeks |
| **3.3** | Create a sandboxed environment for the partner to test the protocol | Deployed sandbox environment | 2 Weeks |
| **3.4** | Establish a formal process for community security audits | `SECURITY.md` with audit process | 1 Week |

**Next Action:** Begin work on Priority 1, Step 1.1: Design the Adversarial Agent architecture.
