# Sovereign Protocol: 5-Year Funding & Impact Projection (Geopolitical & NFP Model)

**To:** Gordon
**From:** The Architect
**Subject:** A Realistic, Non-Dilutive Pathway to Sovereign Scale

### 1. Core Assumptions (Recalibrated)

This model discards traditional venture-backed scaling in favor of a **non-dilutive, grant-funded, and sovereign-first** strategy. The goal is not revenue, but **strategic adoption and the establishment of a global standard.**

*   **Funding Model:** All development and operational costs are covered by a diversified portfolio of grants and strategic funding from sovereign entities. This removes the pressure for premature commercialization and aligns the protocol with public-interest outcomes.
*   **Uptake Model:** The primary metric is not paying "customers," but **"deployments"** across three key sectors: Non-Profit/Open-Source, Sovereign/Regulatory, and select high-impact Enterprise partners. Success is measured by the protocol's integration into critical infrastructure.
*   **Monetisation (Post-Year 5):** Commercial revenue is a long-term outcome, not a short-term driver. It will be realized through the licensing of non-essential bolt-on modules and ecosystem certification, but only after the core protocol is established as a global public good.

### 2. Funding Projections (Grant & Sovereign-Based)

This model projects the required non-dilutive funding to achieve the 5-year roadmap. The focus is on securing a resilient capital base from entities that share the long-term vision.

| Funding Source | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Foundational Grants** | €2.5M | €3M | €5M | €2M | €1M |
| **Sovereign & Defence** | €0 | €1M | €3M | €10M | €20M |
| **Total Non-Dilutive Funding** | **€2.5M** | **€4M** | **€8M** | **€12M** | **€21M** |

**Notes on Funding Sources:**

*   **Foundational Grants:** Sourced from philanthropic organizations focused on digital public infrastructure, open-source technology, and AI safety (e.g., Schmidt Futures, Ford Foundation, Open Society Foundations).
*   **Sovereign & Defence:** Strategic funding from national governments and defence organizations who wish to adopt the protocol as a core part of their own sovereign AI and data infrastructure. This funding is tied to specific pilot projects and national deployments.

### 3. Impact & Uptake Projections (Deployments)

This model tracks the number of active deployments, demonstrating the protocol's growing influence and integration into critical systems.

| Deployment Sector | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Non-Profit / Open-Source** | 2 | 5 | 15 | 30 | 50 |
| **Sovereign / Regulatory** | 1 | 2 | 5 | 10 | 20 |
| **Strategic Enterprise** | 1 | 2 | 5 | 10 | 20 |
| **Total Deployments** | **4** | **9** | **25** | **50** | **90** |

**Notes on Deployments:**

*   **Non-Profit / Open-Source:** Early adoption is driven by the open-source community and non-profits who value the protocol's commitment to public good.
*   **Sovereign / Regulatory:** These are the most strategic deployments, representing entire government agencies or national regulators adopting the protocol.
*   **Strategic Enterprise:** A small number of high-impact enterprise partners who are willing to co-invest in the development of the protocol in exchange for early access and influence.

### 4. Summary: The Path to a Global Standard

This projection outlines a credible, high-integrity path to establishing the Sovereign Protocol as a global standard for trustworthy AI and data governance. By prioritizing non-dilutive funding and strategic adoption over short-term revenue, we build a defensible moat based on trust, neutrality, and deep integration into the world's most critical systems.

**The ultimate outcome is not a company, but an institution.** By Year 5, the protocol will be a self-sustaining public utility, governed by a global council and funded by a diverse coalition of sovereign actors, with a clear path to long-term commercial viability on its own terms.
