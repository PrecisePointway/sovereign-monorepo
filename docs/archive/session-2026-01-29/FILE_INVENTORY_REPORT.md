## 3. Monorepo Structure (In Progress)

The unified monorepo structure has been designed but not yet populated:

```

│   ├── season2/       ← season2-rise-of-partnership
│   └── architecture/
├── infra/
│   ├── core/          ← sovereign-infra
│   ├── deploy/        ← sovereign-deploy
│   └── safe-os/       ← SAFE-OS

## 5. Next Steps

1. **Complete monorepo merge** — Populate the `sovereign/` structure with all cloned repos
2. **Push unified monorepo** — Create `sovereign-monorepo` on GitHub
3. **Sync to local machines** — Deploy to blade and other Tailscale nodes
4. **Archive individual repos** — Mark as deprecated after merge verification
