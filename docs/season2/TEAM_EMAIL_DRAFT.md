Team,

Please find attached the complete Team Distribution Pack for the close-out of Season 1 and the formal kickoff of Season 2.

**What's Included:**

1.  **Team Distribution Pack (PDF/MD):** A single document summarizing all materials, repositories, governance structures, and next steps.
2.  **Season 1 & 2 Archive (.tar.gz):** The complete, immutable archive of all code, documents, and configurations.
3.  **Board Charter:** The ratified governance document defining our new leadership structure.
4.  **Season 2 Kickoff Message:** The official announcement for the wider team.

**Key Takeaways:**

-   **Mission Status:** Season 1 is COMPLETE. The governance kernel is locked.
-   **Governance:** The Board (Steven, John, Gordon) now holds full operational authority. My role is non-executive.
-   **Repositories:** All 7 GitHub repositories are live and production-ready.
-   **Next Steps:** Operational execution is now in your hands. EMEAI, Education, and US Defence tracks are ready to proceed.

Please review the attached materials at your earliest convenience. I am available to discuss any questions, but all operational decisions are now yours to make.

The foundation is set. Season 2 begins now.

Best regards,
