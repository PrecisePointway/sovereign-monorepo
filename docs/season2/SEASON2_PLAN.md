**Version:** 1.0

**Status:** Active
**Classification:** Internal Strategy

## Executive Summary

Season 1 built the unbreakable floor. Season 2 builds the house upon it.

With the governance kernel locked and the Board in operational control, the focus shifts from foundational architecture to market execution, public presence, and partnership development. This plan outlines the first three key objectives and how the KISS stack supports each without creating new dependencies.

---

## The Three Key Objectives

### Objective 1: Establish Public Presence

**Owner:** Steven (CEO & Education)

**Goal:** Launch a clear, professional public face that communicates what Sovereign Sanctuary Systems is and what it is not, without exposing internal systems or creating SaaS dependencies.

**Deliverables:**

| Deliverable | Description | Timeline |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| WordPress Landing Page | Static, professional site on sovereignsanctuarysystems.co.uk | Week 1-2 |
| "What This Is" Page | Clear positioning statement, philosophy, and differentiation | Week 1 |
| Open Source Links | Public links to approved open-source repositories | Week 2 |
| Contact & Updates | Simple contact form and news/update section | Week 2 |

**KISS Stack Support:**

| Tool | Role |
|------|------|
| **WordPress** | Publish the landing page and static content |
| **SiteGround** | Host the site with boring, reliable uptime |
| **Figma** | Create architecture diagrams and visuals for the site (exported as images) |
| **Notion** | Track page status (Not started / In progress / Done) |

**Hard Rule:** WordPress is a shop window. No business logic, no workflows, no governance hidden here.

---

### Objective 2: Operationalize the Board

**Owner:** Board (Steven, John, Gordon)

**Goal:** Transition from founder-led operations to Board-led execution. Establish clear reporting lines, decision protocols, and accountability structures.

**Deliverables:**

| Deliverable | Description | Timeline |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Board Meeting Cadence | Establish regular meeting schedule (weekly/biweekly) | Week 1 |
| Decision Log | Create a simple, auditable log of all Board decisions | Week 1 |
| Reporting Structure | Confirm all team members understand their reporting lines | Week 1 |
| First Board Review | Conduct first formal review of Season 2 priorities | Week 2 |

**KISS Stack Support:**

| Tool | Role |
|------|------|
| **Notion** | Track meeting agendas, action items, and decision log |
| **Local/Repo** | Canonical decisions are committed to the GitHub repo (governance folder) |

**Hard Rule:** Notion is a whiteboard, not a source of truth. If a decision matters, it goes in the repo.

---

### Objective 3: Prepare EMEAI Rollout Framework

**Owner:** John (Industry & EMEAI)

**Goal:** Prepare the go-to-market framework for regulated industries across Europe, Middle East, Africa, and India. Leverage the existing Regulated Infrastructure Framework and AgriCoop as the proof-of-concept.

**Deliverables:**

| Deliverable | Description | Timeline |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Target Industry List | Identify 3-5 regulated industries for initial focus | Week 2 |
| AgriCoop Case Study | Document AgriCoop as the first regulated industry application | Week 2-3 |
| Partnership Criteria | Define criteria for selecting regional partners | Week 3 |
| Pitch Materials | Create investor/partner-facing materials | Week 3-4 |

**KISS Stack Support:**

| Tool | Role |
|------|------|
| **Figma** | Create system flow visuals and investor-friendly diagrams |
| **Notion** | Track target industries, partner pipeline, and status |
| **WordPress** | Publish case study summaries (if public) |
| **Local/Repo** | Canonical framework and specifications remain in GitHub |

**Hard Rule:** Figma is a diagram camera. No decisions are made in Figma. Export images and store locally.

## How the KISS Stack Supports the Transition

The KISS stack is designed to let the world see the work without touching it. Each tool has a single job, and none of them own the system.

| Layer | Tool | Function | Sovereignty Check |
|-------|------|----------|-------------------|
| Coordination | Notion | Organise tasks, track status | If Notion dies, we still win |
| Visualization | Figma | Explain with diagrams | Export-only, no decisions |
| Publication | WordPress | Public-facing content | Static pages, no logic |
| Hosting | SiteGround | Reliable uptime | Migrate in a day if needed |
| **Truth** | **Local/Repo** | **Canonical source** | **Always portable** |

The real system stays:
- **Local** — on your machine
- **File-based** — plain text, Markdown, code
- **Repo-based** — Git, versioned, auditable
- **Portable** — you can leave any platform in a day

## Closing Note

Season 2 is not about building more. It is about executing what we have built, with clarity, discipline, and clean boundaries.

The foundation is set. The Board leads. The Founder-Steward guards the floor.

**Let's build the house.**
