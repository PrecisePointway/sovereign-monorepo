Hi Kelly,

As we formally close out Season 1 and transition into the more structured operational framework of Season 2, I wanted to provide some important clarity around governance and reporting lines. This is a crucial step to ensure we have a clean, scalable, and psychologically safe environment for the entire team.

First, I want to personally acknowledge your significant contributions. Your work has been foundational, and your dedication is deeply valued. This clarification is not a reflection on your performance, which has been excellent, but rather a necessary structural alignment as we mature as an organization.

**The New Governance Structure**

As of today, we are implementing a formal Board structure to handle all operational decision-making. The Board consists of Steven, John, and Gordon. They are now jointly responsible for all delivery, go-to-market, and budget decisions.

**Your Reporting Line**

To align with this new model, your operational reporting line will now be directly to **John and/or Steven**. They will be your primary points of contact for priorities, delivery management, and resource allocation. This change ensures that the operational team has a clear, direct, and empowered leadership channel, free from any ambiguity.

My role is shifting to a non-executive Founder-Steward. This means I am stepping away from all day-to-day operations to focus solely on guarding the constitutional rules of the Sanctuary. There will be no operational reporting to me from anyone on the team.

**Why We Are Doing This**

This structure is designed to protect the team from the bottlenecks and second-guessing that can arise from founder-centric models. It empowers the leadership team to lead decisively and creates clear lines of accountability. It is a system built for professional respect and operational excellence.

Your role remains as critical as ever. This is about putting you in a structure where you can execute with clarity and full support from an operationally-focused leadership team.

I am, as always, here to support you as an individual. Please feel free to schedule time with me to discuss this in person. This is a positive and necessary step for our long-term success.

Best,
