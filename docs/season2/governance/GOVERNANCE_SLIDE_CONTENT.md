# Governance & Authority Structure — Season 2

---

## SLIDE: BOARD CONSTITUTION

### The Board (3 Members, Full Operational Authority)

| Member | Domain | Scope |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Steven** | CEO & Education | Narrative, positioning, public voice |
| **John** | Industry & EMEAI Rollout | Regulated industries, delivery teams |
| **Gordon Stein** | US Market & Defence | Security engagements, zero-trust |

### Board Powers
- Full operational authority
- Delivery accountability
- Go-to-market control
- Budget and execution decisions

### Decision Protocol
- **Majority agreement** required
- **Recorded outcomes** mandatory
- **Clear ownership** per decision
- No unilateral action permitted

---

## SLIDE: FOUNDER-STEWARD ROLE (NON-EXECUTIVE)

### "I am not part of operational decision-making."

| I Do NOT | I DO |
|----------|------|
| Manage delivery | Hold the Sanctuary boundary |
| Control budgets | Guard constitutional invariants |
| Set day-to-day priorities | Support individuals when requested |
| Sit in the reporting chain | Absorb external pressure to protect the team |

### Reserved Authority (Single Exception)
> If a proposal violates the Sanctuary invariants, I can stop that specific action — not the business, not the people.

**"I guard the floor. They build the house."**

### Hard Rule
> There is no operational reporting to the Founder-Steward.
> This is not a soft preference — it is a governance rule.

---

## SLIDE: AUTHORITY BOUNDARIES (HARD RULES)

### The Founder-Steward CANNOT:
- Override board decisions
- Veto delivery choices
- Redirect staff
- Act as escalation path

### Why This Structure Exists

> "If operational authority lives with one person, fear creeps in, people second-guess, and truth bends. This structure is designed so nobody has to read minds or manage personalities."

### This Model:
- Protects psychological safety
- Prevents founder gravity
- Encourages decisive leadership
- Keeps the system honest

---

## SLIDE: ONE-LINE SUMMARY

> **"Steven, John, and Gordon run the company. I make sure the rules never rot. That's the whole system."**

Nothing mystical. Nothing implied.
Just clean engineering.
