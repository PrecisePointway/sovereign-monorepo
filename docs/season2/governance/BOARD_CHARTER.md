**Classification:** Internal Governance Document

---

### 1.0 PURPOSE

This Board Charter defines the governance framework, authority, and operating principles for the Board of Sovereign Sanctuary Systems. Its purpose is to establish a clear, defensible, and efficient structure for operational leadership, ensuring that the company executes its mission while upholding the core constitutional invariants of the Sanctuary. This document provides the definitive guide for decision-making, accountability, and the separation of duties between the operational Board and the non-executive Founder-Steward.

### 2.0 BOARD CONSTITUTION & COMPOSITION

#### 2.1 Board Members

The Board shall consist of the following three (3) members, who collectively hold full operational authority:

| Member | Title & Primary Domain |
|---|---|
| **Steven** | Chief Executive Officer & Education |
| **John** | Head of Industry & EMEAI Rollout |
| **Gordon Stein** | Head of US Market & Defence |

#### 2.2 Joint Authority

The members listed above jointly form the Board. Authority is vested in the Board as a collective entity, not in its individual members. No single board member is authorized to act unilaterally on matters requiring Board approval.

---

### 3.0 BOARD AUTHORITY & RESPONSIBILITIES

The Board is vested with the full and exclusive authority to manage the company's operations. Its responsibilities include, but are not limited to:

- **Strategic Execution:** Translating the company's mission into operational strategy and ensuring its successful implementation.
- **Go-to-Market:** Controlling all aspects of product rollout, market positioning, and client engagement.
- **Financial Oversight:** Establishing budgets, managing expenditures, and ensuring the financial health of the organization.
- **Resource Allocation:** Directing staff, hiring personnel, and organizing delivery teams to meet strategic objectives.
- **Accountability:** Assuming full accountability for operational performance, delivery outcomes, and market success.

---

### 4.0 THE ROLE OF THE FOUNDER-STEWARD (NON-EXECUTIVE)

#### 4.1 Separation of Duties

The Founder-Steward holds a non-executive role, structurally separate from the operational decision-making of the Board. This separation is a core governance principle, designed to protect operational autonomy and prevent founder-centric bottlenecks.

#### 4.2 Prohibited Actions

The Founder-Steward is explicitly prohibited from:
- Overriding or vetoing Board decisions.
- Managing or directing delivery teams or staff.
- Controlling or reallocating budgets.
- Setting day-to-day operational priorities.
- Acting as an escalation path for operational disputes.

#### 4.3 Reserved Authority: Guardian of the Invariants

The Founder-Steward's sole reserved authority is to act as the final guardian of the Sanctuary's constitutional invariants (e.g., zero SaaS dependency, non-extractive models, data sovereignty). If the Board proposes an action that directly violates a documented invariant, the Founder-Steward is authorized to halt that specific action. This authority does not extend to general business strategy, personnel, or operational execution.

> The Founder-Steward guards the constitutional floor. The Board builds the house upon it.

---

### 5.0 DECISION-MAKING & REPORTING

#### 5.1 Decision Protocol

All Board decisions shall be made by **majority agreement** (a minimum of two of the three members). All decisions must be formally recorded, with clear ownership assigned for execution and follow-up.

#### 5.2 Reporting Lines

All operational reporting flows to the Board. There are no operational reporting lines to the Founder-Steward. This is a non-negotiable governance rule.

- **Delivery Teams & Kelly:** Report to John and/or Steven as determined by the Board.
- **Education & Narrative:** Reports to Steven.
- **US Defence & Security:** Reports to Gordon Stein.

---

### 6.0 AMENDMENT OF CHARTER

This Charter may only be amended by the unanimous consent of all three (3) Board members, documented in writing. Any proposed amendment must be reviewed by the Founder-Steward to ensure it does not compromise the Sanctuary's constitutional invariants.
