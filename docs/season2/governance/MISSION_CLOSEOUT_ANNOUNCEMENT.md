Team,

I am writing to formally confirm the successful and final close-out of the Sovereign Governance Kernel mission.

**Mission Status: COMPLETE**

All deliverables have been produced, reviewed, and committed to the canonical record. The work product is final. No further action is required at this time.

**Summary of Completed Work**

| Deliverable | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Season 1 Archive (SANCTUARY_SEASON1_IMMUTABLE.tar.gz) | Sealed |
| Sovereign Sanctuary Codex v1.0 | Canonical |
| Sovereign Sanctuary Manifesto v1.0 | Canonical |
| Regulated Infrastructure Framework | Canonical |
| Board Charter | Ratified |
| Governance Slide Content | Ready |
| Season 2 Repository (season2-rise-of-partnership) | Live |
| All 7 GitHub Repositories | Production-Ready |

**Governance Structure Confirmed**

As documented in the Board Charter, the following governance structure is now in effect:

- **The Board** (Steven, John, Gordon Stein) holds full operational authority.
- **The Founder-Steward** holds a non-executive role, limited to guarding constitutional invariants.
- All operational reporting flows to the Board. There is no operational reporting to the Founder-Steward.

**Boundary Statement**

Any work initiated after this date constitutes a new mission and must be scoped, approved, and documented accordingly. This close-out is not a pause; it is a formal termination of the current scope.

**Acknowledgement**

I want to formally acknowledge the discipline and focus demonstrated throughout this mission. The foundation we have built is sound, defensible, and ready for the next phase of growth.

Season 2 begins now.

Best regards,
