## MISSION SUMMARY

Season 2 established the operational framework for the partnership. It is **not** a compliance product or a regulatory consultancy. It is **governance infrastructure**.

---

## THE CORE ABSTRACTION (LOCKED)

> **"We provide a sector-agnostic governance kernel that resolves the core accountability, evidence, and control problems regulators care about — with optional regulatory lenses layered on top."**

---

## THE SIX INVARIANTS (INDUSTRY-AGNOSTIC)

| # | Invariant | Question It Answers |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Authority** | Who is allowed to decide? Under what conditions? With what checks? |
| 2 | **Accountability** | Who is responsible when something goes wrong? Can this be proven? |
| 3 | **Evidence** | What happened? When? Can it be independently verified? |
| 4 | **Risk Containment** | What could go wrong? What prevents worst-case outcomes? |
| 5 | **Override & Intervention** | How do humans intervene? Who can stop the system? |
| 6 | **Change Control** | What changes over time? Who approved it? Can drift be detected? |

These are the spine. Finance, health, energy, defence, agri, gov — same spine.

---

## THE ARCHITECTURE (LOCKED)

> A **Regulatory-Neutral Governance Kernel** with **pluggable policy lenses**.

**The kernel enforces:**
- Constitutional invariants
- Dual authority
- Evidence chains
- Risk classification
- Intervention rights
- Auditability

**The wrappers translate:**
- EU AI Act
- Financial regulation
- Healthcare standards
- Safety rules
- Internal corporate policies

**Wrappers never change the kernel.**
