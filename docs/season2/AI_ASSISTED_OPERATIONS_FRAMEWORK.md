# AI-Assisted Operations Framework

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 27 January 2026
**Status:** Active
**Classification:** Internal Operations

## 1.0 Principle: The AI is a Coordinator, Not a Governor

This framework outlines how the Sovereign Agent (the AI) will be deployed to assist with Season 2 operations. The core principle is immutable:

> **The AI assists, advises, and automates. It does not decide, command, or govern.**

All final decisions are made by the Board. The AI's role is to augment human intelligence, not replace it. It is a tool for efficiency, not a source of authority.

## 2.0 Deployment Across Workstreams

The Sovereign Agent will be integrated into all major workstreams defined in the 25/90-day plans. Its functions will be tailored to the specific needs of each track.

| Workstream | AI Function | Example Tasks |
|---|---|---|
| **Grant Acquisition** | Research & Drafting Assistant | - Continuously scan for new grant opportunities.<br>- Summarize eligibility requirements.<br>- Draft boilerplate sections of applications.<br>- Track submission deadlines. |
| **Legal & Compliance** | Document Analysis & Tracking | - Summarize legal documents.<br>- Track the status of entity formation.<br>- Compare regulatory requirements across jurisdictions. |
| **Community & Partnership** | Research & Communication Assistant | - Identify potential partners and community leaders.<br>- Draft initial outreach emails.<br>- Monitor community forums for key themes. |
| **Project Management** | Progress Monitoring & Reporting | - Track progress against the 25/90-day plans.<br>- Generate weekly progress reports.<br>- Flag tasks that are falling behind schedule. |
| **Content & Marketing** | Drafting & Analysis Assistant | - Draft blog posts, case studies, and social media updates.<br>- Analyze website traffic and engagement.<br>- Generate visuals from descriptions for Figma. |

## 3.0 The Human-in-the-Loop Protocol

Every action taken by the AI must be auditable and approved by a human operator. We will enforce a strict Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) protocol for all critical operations.

### 3.1 Tiers of AI Action

| Tier | Action Type | HITL Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| **Tier 1: Automated Assistance** | - Research<br>- Summarization<br>- Data analysis | **Passive Review:** AI actions are logged and reviewed periodically by the relevant team member. |
| **Tier 2: Draft Generation** | - Drafting emails<br>- Drafting documents<br>- Filling forms | **Active Review & Approval:** All generated drafts must be reviewed, edited, and approved by a human before being sent or submitted. |
| **Tier 3: External Interaction** | - Sending emails<br>- Posting to social media<br>- Submitting applications | **STRICTLY PROHIBITED:** The AI is not authorized to interact with external systems or individuals on behalf of the organization. All external communication is conducted by human team members. |

### 3.2 The Evidence Chain

Every significant action taken by the AI will be recorded in a cryptographically secured evidence chain, consistent with the principles of the Sovereign Governance System. This ensures a complete and auditable record of all AI-assisted operations.

## 4.0 Technical Implementation

- **Sovereign Agent:** The core AI will be the `sovereign-agent` developed in Season 1, running on our own infrastructure to ensure data sovereignty.
- **Tool Integration:** The agent will interact with the KISS stack tools via their APIs where available, or through browser automation for tools without APIs.
- **Local First:** All data and models will be stored and processed locally wherever possible. Cloud services will be used only when strictly necessary and with a clear data-sovereignty strategy.

## 5.0 The Goal: Augmented Efficiency, Not Autonomous Operation

The purpose of this framework is to make our human team more efficient, not to build a fully autonomous organization. By automating the mundane and time-consuming aspects of our work, we free up our team to focus on what they do best: strategy, creativity, and building relationships.

The AI is a powerful tool, but it is just that—a tool. It serves the team, not the other way around. This framework ensures that we can leverage the power of AI without ever compromising our commitment to human-centric governance and sovereign operations.
