[20:59, 24/12/2025] AJ: o Mr G. I need advise. I’ve created a product and it’s got massive potential. My head is what it is and I need my old mentor to align me to get the thing through patent and launch via investment path. I’ll need a team that side I should imagine. And I ain’t managing anyone or anything so need clever people I can trust.

[22:36, 24/12/2025] Gordon Stein: Merry Christmas 🎄 Andy
Father Christmas 🎅 comes tonight

I cannot get back to you until Boxing Day

[00:28, 25/12/2025] AJ: no rush Mr G - enjoy Xmas. Look forward to it Sir.
