# Flight Control Keyframes v1 (3 frames)

Format: 16:9 (3840x2160) + safe margins for text
Aesthetic: physics sim / Wolfram-like, minimalist, no sci-fi cheese

## Frame 01 — Uncontrolled Flight (0–10s)
NAME: FC_KF01_UNCONTROLLED.png
Visual:
- Dark void.
- Central wireframe “system” (white/cyan) drifting with slight jitter.
- Small red perturbation particles strike the system; trajectory starts to spiral.
Text (minimal, bottom-left):
- "Without control, small errors cascade."

Notes:
- Show instability beginning, not full explosion.
- Camera slow push-in.

## Frame 02 — Safe Envelope + Boardroom Sensors (25–45s)
NAME: FC_KF02_ENVELOPE_SENSORS.png
Visual:
- Semi-transparent torus “safe operating envelope” around system (soft cyan).
- 13 sensor nodes around perimeter (white/gold dots).
- One sensor highlights as system approaches boundary.
- Blue control vector gently nudges system back inward.
Text:
- "13 observers. Thresholds. Controlled correction."

Notes:
- Convey calm authority.
- Sensor activation is the story beat.

## Frame 03 — Override at Bifurcation (50–58s)
NAME: FC_KF03_OVERRIDE.png
Visual:
- Large red perturbation impacts system; envelope boundary flashes red.
- All 13 sensors flare simultaneously.
- A decisive red control vector snaps system back to center; it stabilizes.
Text:
- "Autonomous override at the threshold."

Notes:
- No "uncrashable" language.
- End state: stable, centered, quiet.
