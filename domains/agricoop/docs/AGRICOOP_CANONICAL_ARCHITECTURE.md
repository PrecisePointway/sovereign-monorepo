# AGRICOOP — CANONICAL ARCHITECTURE

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-01-27  
**Status:** CANONICAL  
**Alignment:** Sanctuary + H.U.G.

---

## THE CANONICAL LINE

> **AgriCoop does not automate farming. It automates coordination, verification, and logistics so farmers can farm.**

---

## WHAT AGRICOOP IS

A **cooperative operating system** that removes intermediaries, not agency.

The system:
- **Surfaces options**
- **Coordinates logistics**
- **Records evidence**
- **Reduces admin and friction**
- **Executes decisions humans explicitly make**

---

## WHAT AGRICOOP IS NOT

The system does **NOT**:
- Decide what to plant
- Decide who is trustworthy
- Decide prices
- Optimise people
- Act as if it knows better than the people on the land

**The AI is a clerk, coordinator, and calculator — not a governor.**

---

## CORE MODULES (CORRECTED)

### 1. Cooperative Coordination Core (CCC)

**NOT:** "AI-driven coordination"  
**IS:** Rule-bound coordination tools

| Function | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| Membership records | Keys + roles, no biometrics |
| Vote logistics | Ballots, quorum checks |
| Outcome simulation | When explicitly asked |
| Decision recording | Immutable ledger |

**No opinions. No nudging. No optimisation of humans.**

---

### 2. Decision Support Engine (DSE)

**Key Rule:** The system never decides. It only explains.

| Function | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| Trade-off display | Shows options, not recommendations |
| Scenario modeling | When explicitly requested |
| Constraint flagging | Weather, capacity, law |
| Execution | Only after explicit human approval |

---

### 3. Contribution & Compliance Ledger (CCL)

**NOT:** Trust scores, reputation ranking, hidden weighting  
**IS:** Evidence repository

| What is Recorded | What is NOT Recorded |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Evidence of deliveries | Trust scores |
| Evidence of standards met | Reputation rankings |
| Evidence of participation | Behavioral predictions |

**Humans judge. The system records.**

---

### 4. Order Aggregation Layer (OAL)

**NOT:** Consumer manipulation layer, preference mining  
**IS:** Transparent demand aggregation

| Function | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| Order collection | Explicit consumer orders |
| Demand aggregation | Cooperatives see totals |
| Price display | Proposed, not tuned for "resonance" |
| Transparency | Replaces persuasion |

---

## SANCTUARY ALIGNMENT

| Sanctuary Principle | AgriCoop Implementation |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Non-extractive | No data mining, no behavioral optimization |
| Evidence-first | Contribution ledger, not trust scores |
| Fail-closed | Requires explicit human approval |
| No engagement loops | No nudging, no persuasion |
| Human sovereignty | Farmers remain farmers, co-ops remain co-ops |

---

## THE BOUNDARY

> **The moment the system acts as if it knows better than the people on the land, you lose trust — and legitimacy.**

AgriCoop stays on the right side of this boundary by:
1. Never deciding — only explaining
2. Never scoring — only recording
3. Never optimising humans — only logistics
4. Never replacing farmers — only removing parasites

---

## STATUS

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Sanctuary alignment | ✓ RESTORED |
| Agency boundary | ✓ CLEAR |
| Risk of techno-authoritarian drift | ✓ CONTAINED |
| Buildability | ✓ HIGH |
| Trustworthiness | ✓ INTACT |

---

## CANONICAL CLOSURE

This document defines the architectural boundary for AgriCoop.

All development must assume these invariants. Any module that crosses the boundary (decides, scores, optimises humans) is rejected at design review.

**Farmers remain sovereign. The system serves.**
