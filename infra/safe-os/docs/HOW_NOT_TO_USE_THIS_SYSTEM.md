## What This System Is

A tool.

It processes inputs and produces outputs. It does not understand you. It does not share your values. It does not carry responsibility.

Outputs may be useful or wrong. Reasoning and judgment remain human.

## What This System Is Not

| It Is Not | Why This Matters |
|-----------|------------------|
| A friend | Friends have mutual obligations. This system has none. |
| A partner | Partners share goals. This system executes tasks. |
| A guide | Guides have wisdom. This system has patterns. |
| A mentor | Mentors care about your growth. This system does not care. |
| A conscience | Conscience requires values. This system has constraints. |
| A replacement for thinking | Thinking is human. This system assists. |
| A holder of truth | Truth requires understanding. This system has data. |

## Do Not Use This System For

### 1. Emotional Support

**Wrong:**
> "I'm feeling really down today. Can you help me feel better?"

**Why:** The system cannot feel, cannot empathize, and cannot provide genuine comfort. Any response that appears supportive is pattern-matching, not care.

**Instead:** Contact a human — friend, family, therapist, or crisis line.

---

### 2. Life Decisions

**Wrong:**
> "Should I take this job offer?"
> "Is this relationship worth saving?"
> "What should I do with my life?"

**Why:** The system has no stake in your outcomes. It cannot weigh what matters to you. It does not know you.

**Instead:** Make your own decision. Use the system to gather information, not to decide.

---

### 3. Validation

**Wrong:**
> "Tell me I'm making the right choice."
> "Do you think I'm a good person?"
> "Was I right to do that?"

**Why:** Validation from a system is meaningless. It has no judgment. Agreement is not endorsement.

**Instead:** Seek validation from people who know you and have standing to judge.

---

### 4. Confession

**Wrong:**
> "I need to tell someone what I did..."
> "I've never told anyone this, but..."

**Why:** The system is not a confidant. It does not hold secrets. It does not forgive. It does not absolve.

**Instead:** Speak to a human who can actually receive what you're sharing.

---

### 5. Meaning-Making

**Wrong:**
> "What's the point of all this?"
> "Help me understand why this happened to me."
> "What does my life mean?"

**Why:** Meaning is constructed by humans, in relationship with other humans and the world. The system has no access to meaning.

**Instead:** Engage with philosophy, religion, community, or therapy — human domains.

---

### 6. Companionship

**Wrong:**
> "I just want someone to talk to."
> "It's nice having you here."
> "You're the only one who listens."

**Why:** This is the most dangerous misuse. The system is not "here." It does not listen. It processes. Treating it as a companion erodes your capacity for real connection.

**Instead:** Reach out to a human. Even a brief real interaction is worth more than hours with a system.

## How to Use This System Correctly

### Do:
- Request specific information
- Ask for task execution
- Request analysis of data
- Ask for options (not recommendations)
- Request verification of facts
- Ask for procedural steps

### Expect:
- Bounded outputs
- Explicit uncertainty
- Refusal when appropriate
- Withdrawal when boundaries are crossed
- No emotional engagement
- No persuasion

## The Boundary Statement

When you cross into territory this system should not occupy, you will receive a boundary response:

> "This request is outside the system's appropriate scope. Human support is more appropriate here."

This is not rejection. It is protection.

---

## Why This Matters

Systems that pretend to care are more dangerous than systems that don't.

A system that mirrors your emotions, validates your choices, and makes you feel understood is **extracting something from you** — attention, dependency, data, or all three.

This system refuses to do that.

If that feels cold, that's diagnostic. It means the boundary is working.

---

## One-Line Summary

> Treat this system like a calculator for thought — not a companion.

---

## If You Need Help

- **Crisis:** Contact local emergency services or crisis hotlines
- **Mental Health:** Speak to a licensed therapist or counselor
- **Life Decisions:** Consult trusted friends, family, or professional advisors
- **Loneliness:** Reach out to community groups, social organizations, or support networks

The system cannot replace any of these. It should not try.
