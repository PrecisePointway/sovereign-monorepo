# SOVEREIGN SANCTUARY CODEX — ADDENDUM v1.1

**Date:** 2026-01-27  
**Status:** CANONICAL  
**Amends:** Codex v1.0

## ARTICLE 8: TRUTH IS NOT A COMMODITY

**8.1 The Non-Negotiable Principle:** Core verification tools, evidence chains, and access to recorded reality must remain free at the point of use. No user may pay for epistemic advantage.

**8.2 What "Free" Means Here:**
- Free from monetary gatekeeping on access to facts and verification processes
- Free from engagement-based distortion
- Free from the corruption of scarcity — truth cannot be a limited-edition product

**8.3 What "Free" Does NOT Mean:**
- Subsidized by surveillance, advertising, or data extraction (forbidden under Article 5)
- Unsupported, unreliable, or unsustainable
- A blanket promise that all services have no cost

---

## ARTICLE 9: THE SUSTAINABILITY MODEL

Revenue is permitted **only** for definable, concrete infrastructure — never for truth itself.

| What Can Be Funded | What is Forbidden to Monetize |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| Compute & Bandwidth | Access to Evidence |
| Storage & Infrastructure | Verification Tiers |
| Human Support & Compliance | Influence or Priority |
| Optional Enhanced Tools | The Right to Be Forgotten |

**Canonical Funding Rule:** Money flows for **atoms, not bits** — for the physical substrate, not the informational truth it carries.

---

## ARTICLE 10: THE CANONICAL STATEMENTS

**For System Documentation:**
> "This system is architected so that truth remains a public good. Core verification and access to the evidence chain are free. We sustain operations by charging only for explicit infrastructure, compute, and optional human support — never for truth, priority, or epistemic advantage."

**For Public Facing:**
> **"In a world full of lies, truth must be free — or it becomes just another lie with a receipt."**

## ARTICLE 11: THE SOVEREIGN MEMORY BANK

**11.1 Classification:** The Sovereign Memory Bank is an **external evidence repository**, not a system component. It has no agency, no inference capability, and no execution rights.

**11.2 Formal Statement:**
> The system does not "remember" the human; it may only reference evidence the human has explicitly deposited.

**11.3 Legal Interactions:**

| Operation | Requirements |
|-----------|--------------|
| **READ** | Returns exact stored content, metadata, hash, timestamp. No summary unless explicitly requested. |
| **WRITE** | Requires explicit command, explicit content, explicit scope. No passive capture. Ever. |
| **DELETE** | Immediate. Total. Verifiable. No soft deletes. |

**11.4 Permitted Uses:**
- ✓ Check contradictions
- ✓ Verify claims
- ✓ Confirm completion
- ✓ Anchor "done" states
- ✓ Produce audit trails

**11.5 Forbidden Uses:**
- ✗ Learn from it
- ✗ Optimise against it
- ✗ Generalise from it
- ✗ Treat it as identity
- ✗ Use it to predict behavior

**11.6 The Final Line:**
> **The system has no past. The human may consult records. The system may only point to them.**

## ARTICLE 12: THE SANCTUARY STACK

**12.1 Layer 0 — SANCTUARY (INVIOLABLE)**

This is not a product. It is not a service. It is not monetised. It is the **constitutional layer**.

Properties:
- Read-only
- Deterministic
- Auditable
- Non-extractive
- Non-upgradable except by explicit canon process
- No commercial dependency
- No proprietary lock-in

**Nothing below it can bypass it. Nothing above it can modify it.**

**12.2 Layer 1+ — BOLT-ON CAPABILITIES (OPTIONAL, MONETISABLE)**

Examples: enterprise orchestration, UI/UX shells, vertical agents, analytics (non-manipulative), compliance tooling, sector-specific workflows, integrations, hosting/support/SLA, managed deployments.

All are: replaceable, detachable, optional, sandboxed, revocable.

They **call into** Sanctuary. They **cannot alter** Sanctuary.

**12.3 Licensing Model:**

| Sanctuary Core | Commercial Use |
|----------------|----------------|
| Open | Commercial license |
| Public | Trademark use |
| Verifiable | Certification |
| Forkable (invariant-bound) | Support/assurance |
| No royalties | Compliance attestation |

**12.4 The One-Sentence Positioning:**
> **Sanctuary is the non-negotiable safety and sovereignty layer. Everything else is optional, composable, and commercially licensable.**

**12.5 Critical Invariant:**

Never let revenue:
- dictate core behavior
- add engagement incentives
- weaken shutdown rules
- introduce "exceptions for partners"
- turn safety into a feature toggle

The moment Sanctuary becomes configurable-by-client, it stops being Sanctuary.
